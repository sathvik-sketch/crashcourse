    <h3> "We had already covered the CSS basics in Week 01. Now we are going to dive deep in advanced CSS. We will cover CSS grid & flexbox, but before that, let’s understand few things about the grid & flexbox model.

        Whether it’s criss crossing streets of the suburban landscape or the layout of a newspaper, grids bring order and organization. They also allow designers to group elements in a website layout. Flexbox and CSS grid layouts are both useful in corralling content and graphics, but they work in very different ways.
        
        We’re going to take a look at what makes these layout methods different, how you can apply them in your own web designs, and how to use them together."</h3>
